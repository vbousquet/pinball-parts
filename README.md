# Blender Pinball Parts library

This projects aims at collecting and sharing assessed blender models of common pinball parts (bats, posts, screws,...) in order to ease the process of recreating these pinball tables in 3D to ultimately recreate them in a virtual simulator like [Visual Pinball X](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball) or [Visual Pinball Engine](https://github.com/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine).


# How to use

1. Download this repository as a zip
2. Create a folder somewhere on your hard drive and unpack the downloaded zip in it
3. Add this folder to your Blender asset libraries
4. Visit periodically this page and update by downloading over your previous install


# Guidelines

Assets are splitted in category folders. When an asset (material, texture, node group,...) is used by multiple other assets, it must be placed in the 'Shared' folder.

Each asset should be marked with the following tags:
- To identify it according to its real life equivalent serial number. The template used is the manufacturer followed by the part number. For example, a clear star 1/16" post will be marked with 'Stern 550-5034-01' as well as 'Williams 03-7542-13'.
- To hint on the quality of the model:
   - Quality Scan: the model is made from a 3D scan of a real part, checked against real part measures.
   - Quality Measure: the model is made based on real part measures.
   - Quality Photos: the model was done from pictures of a real part.
   - Quality Imprecise: for preliminary assets that needs to be checked against real world parts.

When valuable references are availables, they are stored along the modeled part (reference picture, datasheet, measures,...).

All files are 'unpacked' blender files, with their textures stored in a children 'Textures' folder.

# Helper add-on

To ease the process a little Blender add-on is provided that adds a button to the asset browser view which will generate thumbnail for the selected assets in the asset browser view (open Blender console to see progress since this can be a lengthy operation).
